This is my first attempt at using version control properly, I'm going to follow whatever the great Odin tells me to.
It feels good to be back on track again, maybe I've been down too many rabbit holes the last two weeks. Can't believe I first registered at github almost 3 weeks ago and it's only today that I get to use it. All of the previous research will make the current project a piece of cake! Hmm, caaake.
